# Rebo

The Rebound project was developed for a database analysis and design class and the final project culminated in a presentation of the "Rebound Requirements Documentation.pdf" file contained in this project.

Rebound is a real non-profit that works with disadvantaged students who have been suspended from public school.  During their suspension they attend counseling and academic tutoring sessions at Rebound.  The needs of each student are assessed so that underlying issues can be identified and addressed, usually by referring the students to available resources in their community.

Grants that fund Rebound have intensive reporting requirements and at the time of the analysis there was no data collection system in place.  All data was kept in excel spreadsheets or paper documents and needed to be tallied manually for each reporting period.

The final report was a summary of the organization's current and future data needs and defines the logical and physical data models demonstrating how these needs could be met.  

A UI design was also developed and a prototype was completed on Moqups.  This facilitated conversations with members of Rebound's Board of Directors and Executive Director about what data strategies would be most effective in relieving staff and volunteers of burdensome data collection and reporting requirements.  The ideas for possible web pages are included in this project as png files.
